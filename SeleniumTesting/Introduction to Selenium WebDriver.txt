Introduction to Selenium WebDriver:
-----------------------------------
	I. Introduction to Selenium WebDriver
	II. WebDriver Environment Setup
	III. Create First Selenium Test Case.
	
Selenium Tool Suite:
	Selenium IDE
	Selemium RC
	Selenium WebDriver
	Selenium Grid

2006 - Selenium 1.0 - (Selenium IDE + Selenium RC + Selenium Grid)

2008 - Selenium 2.0 - (Selenium IDE + Selenium RC + Selenium WebDriver + Selenium Grid)

Note : Selenum RC is only for Maintenance Projects.

Selenium WebDriver : (Features)
--------------------
	- Selenium WebDriver is a powerful Selenium Tool Suite.
	- Selenium WerDrive has a Programming Interface only, it doesn't have an IDE.
	- Selenium WebDriver supports various Programming Languages to write Test Scripts.
	- Selenium WebDriver supports various Browsers to create and Execute the Test Scripts.
	- Selenium WebDriver Supports various Operating Environments.
	- Selenium WebDriver supports Data Driven Testing and Cross Browser Testing.
	- Selenium WebDriver is faster than other tools of Selenium tool Suite because it has Programming Features.
	- With the help of JUnit or TestNG Frameworks, Selenium WebDriver supports Parallel Test Scripts Execution.
	
Drawbacks (Selenium WebDriver) :
--------------------------------
	- Selenium WebDriver doesn't have IDE (Difficult to create Test Cases - No Recording Feature).
	- Selenium WebDriver has no built in Result Reporting Facility.
	- No other tool integration for Test Management.
	- No Centralized Maintenance of Elements/Objects.
	
How to create Test Cases or Test Scripts in Selenium WebDriver:
---------------------------------------------------------------
	- Using Element Locators and WebDriver Commands/Methods (Selenese Commands) we can create Test Cases.
	
Element Locators : 
------------------
	- To identify the elements.
	
WebDriver Commands/Methods :
----------------------------
	- To perform Operations on elements.
	
Java Programming :
------------------
	- For Enhancing Test Cases.
	
TestNG Framework : 
------------------
	- For Grouping Test Cases, Batch testing and Generating Detailed Test Reports.
	
	
Selenium WebDriver Environment Setup :
--------------------------------------
	- Download and Install Java Software(JDK) - To Create Test Scripts.
	- Set Environmental Variable (Path Variable).
	- Download Eclipse IDE and Extract - To Create and Execute Test Scripts.
	- Download WebDiver Java Language Binding and add WebDriver jar files to Java Project in Eclipse IDE.
	- Install Firebug and Firepath Plug ins (Mozilla Firefox Plug ins) for Inspecting Elements in Mozilla Firefox.
	- For Inspecting Elements in Google Chrome and Internet Explorer Browsers we can use Built in Developer tools.
	- Firefox Driver is the Default Driver in Selenium WebDriver. For Internet Explorer and Google Chrome etc., browsers we need to download the respective Browser Drivers.
	
Configuring the Browser Drivers(WebDriver jar Files) to the Java Project : 
-----------------------------------------------------
	- Create a Java Project.
	- Select Java Project and Right Click
	- Select Built Path.
	- Configure Build path.
	- Select "Libraries" tab.
	- Click "Add External jars"
	- Browse path of the WebDriver jars.
	- Add
