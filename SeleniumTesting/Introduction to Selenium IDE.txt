Introduction to Selenium IDE (Integrated Development Environment):
------------------------------------------------------------------
	- It is a Test Tool in the Selenium Tool's Suite to Develop and Execute Test Cases.
	- It is a Firefox Plug in. Works only on Firefox Web Browser.	
	- It provides Graphical User Interface to record user actions using Firefox Browser, but user can Insert/Update/Delete Statements/Steps.
	- Firebug and Firepath are used to inspect elements or we can use Firefox Browser Feature "Page Inspector" for Inspecting Elements.
	- Selenium IDE should only be used as a prototyping tool.
	- We can't develop complex test cases using selenium IDE.(No Programming Logic)
	- Selenium IDE Test Steps:
		- Command + Target + Value(Optional)
			- Command : Forms the functionality of the Step.
			- Target : Identifies the element on the web page.
			- Value : Input Data (Applicable for a few commands)
		- Example:
			type	id=email	samplemail
	- Selenium IDE Test Case Default Format is .html
	- Create Test Cases in Selenium IDE:
		- Using Element Locators and Selnium IDE Commands (Selenese Commands)
	- Create Test Cases in Selenium WebDriver:
		- Using Element Locators and Selenium WebDriver Commands/Methods.
	- Selenium WebDriver Test Steps:
		- Syntax :
			- driverObject.webDriverMethod(By.elementLocator("Locator Value").webDriverMethod;
		- Example :
			- driver.findElement(By.name("username")).sendkeys("MyUsername");
	- Limitations of Selenium IDE:
		- It doesn't support Programming, we can't use programming features for enhancing test cases.
		- It supports Mozilla Firefox Browser only to create and execute test cases, we can't conduct cross browser testing.
		- Not suitable for complex test case design.
		- No centralized maintenance of Elements/Objects.
		- Data Driven Testing is not possible.
		- No Detailed Test Reports, generates Summary only.
	- Selenium IDE features:
		- File Menu:
			- Options for Test Case and Test Suite
			- Create New Test Case
			- Open Existing Test Case
			- Save Test Case
			- Export Test Case in a Suppoting Language
			- All the above options are also avialable for Test Suite.
		- Edit Menu:
			- Copy, Cut, Paste, Delete, Undo etc., for editing Test Cases.
			- Insert Command
			- Insert New Comment etc.
		- Actions Menu:
			- Record and Run Test Case.
			- Run Test Suite.
			- Insert/Remove Break Points.
			- Pause/Resume Test Execution etc.
		- Options Menu:
			- Allows us to change Selenium IDE settings, we can change Timeout value etc.
		- Help Menu:
			- It provides help documentation for selenium IDE.
	- Test Case Pane in Selenium IDE:
		- Test Case/Test Script is displayed in Test Case Pane.
		- It has 2 tabs:
			- Table Format - Displays Commands and Parameters.
			- Source Format - Displays in HTML format (Native Format).
	- Using Element Locators and Selenese Commands we can create Test Cases.
	- We can create Test Cases in 2 ways:
		- By Recording.
		- By typing Test Cases Manually. ( Use id/name/link/xpath)
	- 2 Types of Selenese commands:
		- General Commands
		- Verification Commands (Assert/Verify).
