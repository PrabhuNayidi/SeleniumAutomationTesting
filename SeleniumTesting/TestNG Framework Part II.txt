TestNG Framework Part II:
-------------------------

	- Executing Multiple Test Cases (Classes)using XML file:
	  ------------------------------------------------------
	  	<suite name = "suiteName">
	  		<test name = "testName">
	  			<classes>
	  				<class name = "className1">
	  				<class name = "className2">
	  				<class name = "className3">
	  			</classes>
	  		</test>
	  	</suite>
	  	
	  - Select a Package in the java project and right click -> select New -> select Other -> Type TestNG in Wizards -> Select TestNG Class -> click Next -> Give Source Folder, Package Name, Class Name, xml suite name.
	
	- TestNG Annotations:
	  -------------------
	  		- @Test -> The Annotated Part is a part of a Test Case.
	  		
	  		- @BeforeMethod -> The Annotated Method will be executed before each Test Method.
	  		- @AfterMethod -> The Annotated Method will be executed after each Test Method.
	  		
	  		- @BeforeClass -> The Annotated Method will be executed before invoking the first Test Method of the current class.
	  		- @AfterClass -> The Annotated Method will be executed after invoking all the Test Methods of the current class.
	  		
	  		- @BeforeTest -> The Annotated Method will be executed before any Test Method mentioned within the Classes tag in the xml file.
	  		- @AfterTest -> The Annotated Method will be executed after all Test Methods mentioned within the Classes tag in the xml file.
	  		
	- Grouping Test Cases:
	  --------------------
	  	<suite name = "suiteName">
	  		<test name = "testName">
	  			<groups>
	  				<run>
	  					<include name="groupName">
	  				</run>
	  			</groups>
	  			<classes>
	  				<class name = "className1">
	  				<class name = "className2">
	  				<class name = "className3">
	  			</classes>
	  		</test>
	  	</suite>
