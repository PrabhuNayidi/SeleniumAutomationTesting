Introduction to TestNG:
-----------------------

- Overview
- Install TestNG and write First TestNG Test Case
- Create Multiple Test Cases in TestNG and Run.
- Execute Multiple Test Cases using XML.

Overview:
---------
	- There are two Testing Frameworks available in Selenium based on Java:
		- JUnit
		- TestNG (NG stands for Next Generation)
	- TestNG Testing Framework:
		- JUnit(Java Platform) + NUnit(.NET Platform) + Additional Functionalities = TestNG (More Powerful and Easy to Use).
		- TestNG Testing Framework is designed to simplify a broad range of testing needs from Unit Testing to System Testing.
		- TestNG framework was initially developed for Unit Testing and is now being used for all kinds of testing.
		- TestNG is an Open Source Testing Framework. 	
	- Advantages of TestNG:
		- TestNG Annotations are easy to use in creating the Test Cases.
		- Grouping and Prioritization of Test Cases can be done easily.
		- Supports Parameterization.
		- Supports Data Driven Testing using Dataproviders.
		- Generates Detailed Test Reports in HTML format.
		- Parallel Test Execution is possible.
		- Supports Integration with other tools and Plug ins like Eclipse IDE, Build Tools like Maven, Ant.
		- In a brief sentence TestNG Testing Framework can be used to Create Test Cases, Group Test Cases, Prioritize Test Cases, Execute Test Cases and Generate Detailed Test Reports.
	- main() Method is not used for the TestNG Test Cases.
	- TestNG Test Cases (Java Class Files) contains only Methods that contain @TestAnnotations.
	- Methods won't be Executed if we didn't mention the TestNG Test Annotations.
	- TestNG Test Cases (Multiple Test Cases in a single java class file) are executed in an alphabetical order.
	- If you want to execute multiple Test Cases in a Particular Order, you have to use priority Attribute on TestNG Annotations.
	
TestNG Installation in Eclipse IDE:
-----------------------------------
	- Help Menu -> Install New Software -> Click Add -> Enter Name as "TestNG" -> Enter URL as "http://beust.com/eclipse/" -> Select "TestNG" -> -< Next -> Next -> Accept the Agreement -> Finish
	

Note : (See SampleTestCase5.java file in com.testngframework package)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
	- Hard Dependency -> @Test(dependsOnMethods={"methodName"}) -> After Test Case Failure, the remaining Test Cases won't be executed
	- Soft Dependency -> @Test(dependsOnMethods={"methodName"}, alwaysRun=true) -> After Test Case Failure, the remaining Test Cases can be executed
